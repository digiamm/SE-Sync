# SE-Sync


**SE-Sync** is a *certifiably correct* algorithm for performing *synchronization over the special Euclidean group*: estimate the values of a set of unknown *poses* (positions and orientations in Euclidean space) given noisy measurements of a subset of their pairwise relative transforms.  This problem frequently arises in the context of 2D and 3D geometric estimation; for example, the foundational problems of [pose-graph SLAM](http://domino.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/teaching/ws11/robotics2/pdfs/ls-slam-tutorial.pdf) (in robotics), [camera motion estimation](http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/ftp/articles/pajdla/Martinec-Pajdla-CVPR-2007.pdf) (in computer vision), and [sensor network localization](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3741000/) (in distributed sensing) all require synchronization over the special Euclidean group.  SE-Sync improves upon prior methods by exploiting a novel (convex) *semidefinite relaxation* of the special Euclidean synchronization problem to directly search for *globally optimal* solutions, and is capable of producing a *computational certificate of correctness* (global optimality) in the (typical) case that a global minimizer is found.

A detailed description of the algorithm and its implementation can be found in our [journal article](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/SE-Sync%20-%20A%20certifiably%20correct%20algorithm%20for%20synchronization%20over%20the%20special%20Euclidean%20group.pdf) and its companion [technical report](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/SE-Sync%20-%20A%20Certifiably%20Correct%20Algorithm%20for%20Synchronization%20over%20the%20Special%20Euclidean%20Group.pdf).



## Getting Started

### MATLAB

To use the MATLAB implementation of SE-Sync, simply place the 'MATLAB' folder in any convenient (permanent) location, and then run the script MATLAB/import_SE_Sync.m.  Congrats!  SE-Sync is now ready to go :-).  For a minimal working example, see [MATLAB/examples/main.m](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/MATLAB/examples/main.m)

### C++

The C++ implementation of SE-Sync can be built and exported as a CMake project.  For a minimal working example, see [C++/examples/main](https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync/blob/master/C%2B%2B/examples/main.cpp), which provides a simple command-line utility for processing .g2o files.

#### C++ quick installation guide

The following installation instructions have been verified on Ubuntu 18.04:

*Step 1:*  Install dependencies
```
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake-gui liblapack-dev libblas-dev libsuitesparse-dev
```

*Step 2:*  Clone the repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/david-m-rosen/SE-Sync.git SESync
```

*Step 3:*  Initialize Git submodules
```
$ cd SESync
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

*Step 4:*  Create build directory
```
$ cd C++ && mkdir build
```

*Step 5:*  Configure build and generate Makefiles
```
$ cd build && cmake ..
```

*Step 6:*  Build code
```
$ make [-jN, where N is the number of cores to use for parallel compilation]
```

*Step 7:*  Run the example command-line utility on some tasty data :-D!
```
$ cd bin
$ ./SE-Sync ../../../data/sphere2500.g2o 
```
